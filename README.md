# ibm-cloud-backup-notebook

This notebook was inspired by the [IBM Cloud backup tool](https://github.com/modlanglais/ibm-cloud-backup). This notebook will, given the credentials, backup the data in an instance of Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery. The data will be saved in the Watson Studio project it is executed in as a set of assets.
